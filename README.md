# OpenGL-Project

This is a project for Computer Graphics at Adam Mickiewicz University. The project includes a room that contains full PBR texturing, implemented Bloom and "Fire Rendering".

You can see the shadows cast by the sun, whose light comes through the window. Shadows are also cast by the X-Wing's flashlight.

Interaction with the sofa and TV is also implemented. Looking at the couch and being close to it and clicking 4 moves us to it. Being close to the sofa seat and clicking 5 turns the TV on or off.
